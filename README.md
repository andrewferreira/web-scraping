# web-scraping
A set of web scraping programs and projects written in python 2.7

I have primarily used the Beautiful Soup library for HTML and XML parsing and a combination of the Requests and the Urrlib libraries for get requests to the server. Due to javascript screen load restrictions, I have used the headless browser 'Chromedriver' to get the entire page scraped successfully for some projects.

Most of the object identification and querying is done using the native BS4 html tree parser. If you prefer using scripts with other selectors like XPath selectors, it may be best to look elsewhere for web scraping examples. 

Most of these scripts are website specific and can't really be used as a generic solution, you may read them to have a look at examples of the use of these library combinations for web scraping.
